# Django-E-commerce
As I'm starting DJANGO the first project I've started was an E-commerce site. well not the first but the others weren't mention worthy. it was fun learning these new concepts i know its not much of a big deal but you've got to start somewhere ig.

there is an index page which shows the Products added to the db using pagination, a detail page which shows some info about the product and a checkout page with a table of items you've added to your cart which takes the shipping information and sends it to the admin panel. 

one of the problem I've encountered was with building a 'Shopping cart' using js that took me a lot of debugging but thanks to AI i was able to understand the logic. its not perfect and still have some minor bugs but it work :)
